        <h2>What is ACM</h2>
        <br>
        ACM is a professional society
        dedicated to advancing human capabilities through information
        technology. Founded in 1947, the Association for Computing Machinery
        (ACM) is the largest and oldest international scientific and educational
        computer society in the industry today. Organized only a year after the
        unveiling of ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer, ACM
        was established by mathematicians and electrical engineers to advance
        the science and application of information technology.
